Several python scripts for the evaluation of ride comfort in vehicles follwing diverse standards, such as EN 12299 or Wz-Method.

## Current state
+ EN 12299: filtering implemented
+ Wz: Filtering and calculation of Wz-values

## To Do
+ ISO 2631: additional filters need to be implemented
+ ISO / EN: RMS, VDV, ... missing
+ Random test signal generator
+ Maybe introduce ```sensor objects``` that contain multiple acceleration channels
